# Amazon Clone Website

## Introduction

This project is an Amazon clone website created using React and Tailwind CSS with the Vite build tool. While the website is not fully responsive, it serves as a demonstration of building a modern e-commerce platform with popular web development technologies.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- Vite: A fast, opinionated web development build tool that serves as a replacement for Create React App.

## Features

- Product Listing: Display a list of products with relevant information.
- Product Details: Show detailed information about a selected product.
- Shopping Cart: Allow users to add products to a cart and proceed to checkout.
- Responsive Design (Partial): While not fully responsive, some aspects of the design may adapt to different screen sizes.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shrikantg199/amazon-clone.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd amazon-clone
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the development server, and you can view the website by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Usage

- Explore the product listings and click on a product for more details.
- Add products to the shopping cart and proceed to checkout.
- Note: Due to the lack of full responsiveness, the user experience may vary on different devices.
